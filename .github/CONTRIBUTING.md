### How to contribute?

All contributors are welcome!

You can choose to contribute in multiple ways:
- comment and pick up an [issue](https://github.com/danalex97/Speer/issues)
- create a [new issue](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- mail me on dan.alex97@yahoo.com and ask for work

If you are not sure how you can contribute write in the [contributor thread](https://github.com/danalex97/Speer/issues/33).

Once you finish the work on an issue, you can create a [pull request](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Github will let you choose between the templates for [bugs](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and [feature requests](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).
